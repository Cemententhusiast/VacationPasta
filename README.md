VacationPasta - In case you for some reason you need a voicemail system in Discord.

Using the JDA library for Java you can create a Discord bot which responds to whenever a user is pinged on a server with a preset message.

Commands:
  
  /enable [message] - Allows you to set a message to be displayed when a user pings you
  
  /shutup           - Stops the replying and deletes your preset message
